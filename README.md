# CRC32-Q IMPLEMENTATION

A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to digital data. Blocks of data entering these systems get a short check value attached, based on the remainder of a polynomial division of their contents.

This project focusing on CRC32-Q modification. 

*You can change the polynomial parameters as well as the REG_INIT and XOR_OUT values at any time.*

Below are the values for CRC32-Q.

```C
#define POLY 0x814141AB
#define REG_INIT 0x0 
#define XOR_OUT 0x0
```

You can find out parameters [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check).
